But,college girls need to learn too! Many times, college students get together once a month for the purpose of MSA meetings anyways. Wouldn’t it be nice for this group to channel some of that energy into studying authentic sources of Islamic learning. With this program, students will take courses on Diseases of the Heart, Seerah, Fiqh, and Hadith.Each student will receive a packet comprised of a reading list, syllabus, discussion questions to guide their learning, study guides, and tests to ensure learning. Each course will be taught by a teacher online while students are completing their work together as a group. There should be lots of learning, discussions, and meaningful interaction as a result of this work.</h5>\r\n    <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default ILM101\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
