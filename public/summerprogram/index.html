My daughter Sara went for 2 years. And this year Insha-Allah I am looking forward to enroll my younger daughter Zaynab too. I was very impressed with the program and the entire staff. They were organized, professional, kind, respectful, nurturing and engaging. Overall it is an excellent program and a wonderful experience for my daughter. It gives her the opportunity to learn a variety of things in an Islamic environment. She thoroughly enjoyed the entire program and one of her favorite was the field trip to a food market and recycle store (going green). It is indeed great having such a stress-free environment in which girls do not have to feel the pressure of performing to someone else’s standards. And may Allah bless you all for all your hard work and for having touched so many lives at Camp Busy Bee.

Safa has been attending the camp for many years.  She and I look forward to it each year. Knowledge is provided in a beautiful manner that all ages benefit from.  The teachers are very nice and well experienced. We are once again looking forward to this summer’s camp.  I also feel that the young youth needs to have a good strong muslim community that will grow with them.  Camp Busy-Bee I feel has that leadership that can guide many girls on the right path.</p><cite>Sameena  Abdur Rehman, Mother, (MSI, Glendale Heights)</cite></blockquote></li><li data-index="3" class="slick-slide slick-cloned" tabindex="-1" style="outline:none"><blockquote><p>I am a huge fan of Camp Busy Bees.
