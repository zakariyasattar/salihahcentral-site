        <p>This day camp is a four-week summer program that serves Muslim youth entering grades 1st through 8th.
The camp provides meaningful, well-rounded Islamic learning in an engaging environment. Participants become equipped with a strong sense of identity, an increased level of confidence, and an appreciation of Quranic knowledge.  Students come to realize that practical Islam can be fun and even more worthwhile than other popular or commercial ways of passing time. Alhamdulillah, we have completed 12 summers of operation through popular demand! This camp is held in select masjids throughout the Chicagoland Area.
