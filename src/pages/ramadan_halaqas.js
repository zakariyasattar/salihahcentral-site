  <h1>Ashr Talks</h1>
  Join Anse Amina Sayeed as she prepares us to honor our guest Ramadan in all three stages of its visit- the beginning, middle, and the end.  As the days of Ramadan past and as Ramadan feels more comfortable in our homes, these talks will give us the direction we'll need in order to care for our guest and maximize benefit from it's presence. Recognizing Mercy, seeking forgiveness, and landing at freedom from the Bondage of Hellfire is our journey with our guest and Ramadan will lead the way.
