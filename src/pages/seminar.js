  <tab2></tab2>Salihah Central invites young adult women and adult women to attend the 2020 Pre Ramadan Workshop as we explore this year’s theme:  Rediscovering our inner strength and enacting change that starts with the self. Current events provide more reason to understand how the inner self translates to serenity during difficult times and incurs help from the Only Source of help, Allah.   Change for the better is inevitable when effort towards the self is the focus and Ramadan is the best time for this change.  Two parallel workshops will run simultaneously insha’Allah: young adult and adult women. Session titles include, gaining strength from inspiring women trailblazers of the past, confronting spiritual diseases of the current times, and finding inevitable contentment in our own unique, protected spaces.  Don’t miss this valuable opportunity to connect with women virtually as we gather our energy in order to maximize and benefit from Ramadan 2020.
