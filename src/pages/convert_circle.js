  <h1>Convert Circle</h1>
  Convert Circle is a place where participants new to Islam can find a safe and comfortable space to ask questions, learn basics, get support, and act as a connector to others that share the same experiences.  It's not easy taking on a new way of life; it's exciting, but with so much unknown, it's hard to know where to begin.  With Convert Circle, we can eliminate a lot of the uncertainty and replace it with practical answers that are easy and make sense. Answers that address the unique challenges converts face in integrating Islam into their daily life are addressed.  We understand that it takes a community to support those who chose Islam and we want to be that community.
