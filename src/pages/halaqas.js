  <p>Salihah Central offers regular halaqas (lecture gatherings) for women in the Chicagoland area. Led by Anse Amina, the halaqas address a
  range of topics in spiritual development and issues that matter most in women’s lives. For over a decade, these gatherings have been Anse Amina’s flagship sessions in her work with the women
  of her community. The gatherings have continued to be an opportunity for attendees to focus on themselves and reset spiritually.</p>

  <p>
  The gatherings are held every other Wednesday evening in Park Ridge,
   IL. For more information, <a href="/#calender">See Our Calender</a>
