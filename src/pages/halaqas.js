  Allah has commanded us to know the Prophet Muhammad and what better way to do this than to study seerah under qualified teachers. Studying seerah is an obligation that has put upon us as stated in the Holy Quran and Hadith:,

  Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad SAW) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah much. Qur’an [33:21]

  Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “None of you have faith until I am more beloved to him than his children, his father, and all of the people.”
